    "dialogue": "Remember the guy who pretended he had cancer so O would buy him the toupee?"
  },

  },
  {
    "character": "ELAINE",

  },
  {
    "character": "GEORGE",
    "dialogue": "She probably never heard it. Don't you see what this means? It's like the whole thing never happened. It's like when Superman reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane!"

  },
  {
    "character": "GEORGE",

  },
  {
    "character": "GEORGE",
    "dialogue": "Let me just say this. It is inhumane to make a man stand on his feet, in one spot for eight hours a day. Why shouldn't he have a chair?"

  },
  {
    "character": "ELAINE",
    "dialogue": "Well, I mean don't you think that he was probably called Maestro while he was conducting, not in social situations. I mean his friends probably just called him Lenny."
  },
  {
    "character": "MAESTRO",
    "dialogue": "I happen to know for a fact, that he was called Maestro in social situations. I once saw him at a bar and someone came up to him and said \"Hello Maestro, how about a beer\". O.K. So that's a fact."

  },
  {
    "character": "GEORGE",

    "character": "GUARD",
    "dialogue": "Obviously I'd rather sit than stand, if that's what your asking."
  },

    "dialogue": "Your damn right you screwed up. Where the hell did you get that damm balm anyway?"
  },

    "character": "JACKIE",
    "dialogue": "Oh oh oh, so a Maestro tells you to put a balm on and you do it?"
  },
  {
    "character": "JACKIE",
    "dialogue": "Do you know what a balm is? Have you ever seen a balm? Didn't you read the instructions?"
  },
  {
    "character": "JACKIE",

  },
  {
    "character": "JERRY",
    "dialogue": "So what about the \"Maestro\" stuff. Did he make you call him Maestro."
  },
  {
    "character": "JERRY",

    "character": "GEORGE",
    "dialogue": "Yup. It's really just a question of what kind. Thinking about a bar stool."
  },
  {
    "character": "JERRY",

  },
  {
    "character": "GEORGE",
    "dialogue": "You see I disagree. I'd rather be dating the blind. You know you could let the house go. You could let yourself go. A good looking blind woman doesn't even know you're not good enough for her."

  },
  {
    "character": "GEORGE",

  },
  {
    "character": "KRAMER",

  },
  {
    "character": "KRAMER",
    "dialogue": "Evidently.  Oh, by the way, tell Brett that his chest of drawers are a big hit. My guests are very comfortable in them."

    "character": "KRAMER",
    "dialogue": "Jerry, have you ever seen the business hotels in Tokyo? They sleep in tiny stacked cubicles all the time. They feel right at home."

  },
  {

    "dialogue": "Brett said you ran away from him, as if he were the boogetyman."
  },
  {
    "character": "ELAINE",

    "character": "GEORGE",
    "dialogue": "Great news! I showed the pilot to Kramer's Japanese friends. They loved it!"
  },

    "dialogue": "No, well, I set their alarm. But they did have a lot of sake in that hot-tub."
  },
